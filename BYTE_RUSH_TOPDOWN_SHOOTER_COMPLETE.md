# Byte Rush - Top-Down Shooter Implementation

## Overview
Byte Rush is a top-down shooter arcade game fully integrated into the Byte Club platform. The game features a tech/digital theme with dark aesthetics, polished graphics, smooth animations, and complete game logic.

## Game Mechanics

### Player Controls
- **Movement**: Arrow Keys or WASD (Up/Down/Left/Right)
- **Shooting**: Spacebar
- **Pause**: P key
- Player ship moves in all directions within canvas bounds
- Player shoots bullets upward automatically when Space is held

### Enemy Types
1. **Basic** (Red) - 10 points
   - Moves straight down
   - 1 health

2. **Fast** (Cyan) - 20 points
   - Moves down at double speed
   - 1 health

3. **Tank** (Yellow) - 50 points
   - Moves slowly down
   - 3 health (requires 3 hits to destroy)

4. **Zigzag** (Purple) - 30 points
   - Moves in zigzag pattern using sine wave
   - 1 health

### Powerups
- **Health Pack** (Green) - Restores 1 health point
- **Shield** (Purple) - 10 seconds of invincibility
- **Rapid Fire** (Yellow) - Triples shooting speed for 15 seconds

### Wave Progression
- Enemies spawn based on wave number
- Spawn rate increases with each wave
- New wave starts when all enemies are cleared
- Enemy types vary based on wave progression:
  - Wave 1: Only Basic enemies
  - Wave 2-3: Basic + Fast enemies
  - Wave 4-5: Basic + Fast + Zigzag
  - Wave 6+: All enemy types including Tank

### Health System
- Player starts with 3 health points
- Player has 3 lives
- When health reaches 0, player loses 1 life
- Game over when all lives are lost

### Scoring
- Points awarded for destroying enemies
- Score based on enemy type and difficulty
- Final score submitted to leaderboard on game over

## Technical Implementation

- Manages player, bullets, enemies, powerups, particles
- Collision detection for bullets vs enemies
- Collision detection for enemies vs player
- Wave progression logic
- Powerup spawning and collection
- Particle effects system

#### `ByteRushGameCanvas.tsx`
- HTML5 Canvas rendering component
- Continuous animation loop using requestAnimationFrame
- Draws player, enemies, bullets, powerups, particles
- Grid background pattern
- UI overlays (score, lives, wave, health)
- Pause/Game Over screens

#### `ByteRush.tsx`
- Main game page component
- Hero section with features
- Game stats display
- Leaderboard integration
- Score submission on game over

#### `ByteRushHUD.tsx`
- Game HUD display (Right panel)
- Leaderboard display
- Game stats
- Control buttons

#### `ByteRushGameOverModal.tsx`
- Game over screen
- Final score display
- Wave reached
- Restart/Exit buttons

### Backend API

#### GET `/api/byte-rush/leaderboard`
- Fetches top scores from database
- Returns sorted list by score (descending)

#### POST `/api/byte-rush/score`
- Saves player score to database
- Requires authentication
- Stores score, wave, user info, timestamp

#### GET `/api/byte-rush/stats`
- Returns game statistics
- Total players, total scores, average score

### Database Schema

#### ByteRushScores Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId (reference to User),
  username: String,
  score: Number,
  wave: Number,
  createdAt: Date
}
```

Indexes:
- `score` (descending) for fast leaderboard queries
- `userId` for user-specific queries

## Visual Design

### Color Scheme
- Background: #0a0e14 (Dark blue-black)
- Grid: #1a1f2e (Dark gray-blue)
- Player: #00fff9 (Neon cyan)

- Enemy Bullets: #ff0000 (Red)
- Enemies: Red, Cyan, Yellow, Purple variants
- Powerups: Green, Purple, Yellow
- Explosions: #ff8787 (Pink)

### Effects
- Particle explosions on enemy destruction
- Shield visual effect (dashed border around player)
- Neon glow effects on all game entities
- Smooth animations for all movements
- Grid background for tech aesthetic

## Game Flow

1. **Start Screen**: Player sees hero section, features, and statistics
2. **Game Start**: Click "Start Run" button
3. **Gameplay**: 
   - Player spawns at bottom center
   - Enemies spawn from top
   - Player moves and shoots
   - Collect powerups
   - Clear all enemies to advance wave
4. **Game Over**: 
   - Score submitted to leaderboard
   - Modal displays final score and wave
   - Option to restart or exit
5. **Leaderboard**: Shows top scores on main page

## Responsive Design
- Canvas size: 800x600 pixels (desktop)
- Works on desktop and mobile
- Touch controls optional for mobile

## Performance Optimizations
- Efficient collision detection (AABB)
- Particle cleanup
- Entity pooling considerations
- Smooth 60 FPS animation loop

## Future Enhancements
- Sound effects (shooting, explosion, powerup)
- Background music
- Boss enemies on every 10th wave
- Additional powerup types
- Mobile touch controls
- Achievements system
- Daily/weekly challenges
