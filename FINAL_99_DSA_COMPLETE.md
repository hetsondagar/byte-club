## 🔧 **MAINTENANCE & EXPANSION**

### **To Add More Challenges:**

1. Open `backend/src/scripts/seed99Challenges.ts`
2. Add new challenge object following the existing pattern:
```typescript
{
  slug: "new-challenge-slug",
  title: "Challenge Title",
  difficulty: "easy" | "medium" | "hard",
  xpReward: 100 | 200 | 300,
  tags: ["array", "hash-table"],
  content: {
    question: "Problem statement...",
    starterCode: "function name() { }",
    testCases: [{ input: "...", expected: "..." }],
    correctAnswer: "Complete solution"
  },
  isActive: true
}
```
3. Re-run seed script
4. Challenge automatically appears in frontend
