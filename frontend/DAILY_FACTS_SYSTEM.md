## ⚙️ How It Works

### **Daily Rotation Algorithm:**

```typescript
export function getDailyFact(): string {
  const now = new Date();
  const start = new Date(now.getFullYear(), 0, 0);
  const diff = now.getTime() - start.getTime();
  const oneDay = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;
  const dayOfYear = Math.floor(diff / oneDay);
  
  // Use day of year to pick a fact (cycles through all 150)
  const index = dayOfYear % cseFacts.length;
  return cseFacts[index];
}
```

**Logic:**
1. Calculate current day of year (1-365)
2. Use modulo to get index (0-149)
3. Return fact at that index
4. **Same fact all day**, changes at midnight
5. **Cycles through all 150** facts throughout the year

## 🎬 Animations

### **Entrance:**
```tsx
initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
transition={{ delay: 1.2 }}
```

### **Lightbulb Icon:**
```tsx
animate={{
  rotate: [0, 10, -10, 10, 0],  // Wobble
  scale: [1, 1.1, 1],             // Pulse
}}
transition={{
  duration: 3,
  repeat: Infinity,
  repeatDelay: 2,
}}
```

### **Background Gradient:**
```tsx
animate={{
  backgroundPosition: ["0% 50%", "100% 50%", "0% 50%"],
}}
transition={{
  duration: 10,
  repeat: Infinity,
}}
```
