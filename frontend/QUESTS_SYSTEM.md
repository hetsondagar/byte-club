## 🎨 Visual Design

### Color Schemes
Each quest has unique gradient colors:
- **Quest 1:** `from-cyan-400 to-blue-600`
- **Quest 2:** `from-violet-500 to-fuchsia-600`
- **Quest 3:** `from-orange-400 to-red-500`
- **Quest 4:** `from-blue-500 to-teal-500`

### Animations
- **Framer Motion** for all transitions
- Entrance animations (fade-in, slide-up, scale)
- Hover effects (glow, lift, scale)
- Typewriter text effect for stories
- Pulse animations for active states
- Confetti on mission completion
- Smooth progress bar fills

### UI Components
- **NeonCard** with variants and glow
- **NeonBadge** for difficulty/tags
- **Buttons** with cyber/neon variants
- **Dialog** for code terminal modal
- **Textarea** for code editor
- **Toast** for notifications

## 🔐 Progress Tracking

### LocalStorage Keys

**Quest Progress:**
```json
{
  "byte_club_quest_progress": {
    "progress": {
      "quest-1": 66.67,
      "quest-2": 33.33
    },
    "completed": ["quest-1"]
  }
}
```

**Mission Completion:**
```json
{
  "byte_club_quest_<id>_missions": [
    "mission-1a",
    "mission-1b",
    "mission-1c"
  ]
}
```

### Logic
- Quest 1 is always unlocked
- Each quest unlocks after previous is complete
- Missions unlock sequentially within a quest
- Progress percentage = (completed missions / total missions) × 100
- Quest marked complete when all missions done
