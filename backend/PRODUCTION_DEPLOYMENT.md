# Byte Club Backend - Production Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Production Readiness Checklist

### 1. TypeScript Compilation ‚úÖ
- All TypeScript errors have been fixed
- Build process completes successfully (`npm run build`)
- No compilation warnings or errors

### 2. Dependencies & Imports ‚úÖ
- All imports are properly configured
- No missing dependencies
- Package.json is up to date

### 3. MongoDB & Migrations ‚úÖ
- MongoDB connection configured
- Migrations system working correctly
- Database indexes created for optimal performance
- Schema consistency verified

### 4. CORS Configuration ‚úÖ
- Environment-aware CORS setup
- Production origins configured
- Development origins allowed for local testing
- Security headers properly set

### 5. Security ‚úÖ
- Helmet middleware enabled
- JWT authentication working
- Environment variables properly configured
- No sensitive data in code

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables in your production environment:

```bash
# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production

# Database
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN=30d

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Judge0 API (for code execution)
RAPIDAPI_JUDGE0_KEY=your-rapidapi-key-here
RAPIDAPI_JUDGE0_HOST=judge0-ce.p.rapidapi.com
```

### 2. Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Run Migrations (if needed)
```bash
npm run migrate
```

### 4. Start the Server
```bash
npm start
```

## üîß Production Configuration

### CORS Origins
The following origins are allowed in production:
- `https://byte-club.vercel.app`
- `https://www.byte-club.vercel.app`
- `https://byte-club-frontend.vercel.app`

Update these in `src/index.ts` if your frontend URLs are different.

### Security Features
- Helmet.js for security headers
- CORS properly configured
- JWT authentication
- Input validation
- Error handling middleware

### Performance Optimizations
- Database indexes created
- Compression middleware enabled
- Connection pooling configured
- TTL indexes for session cleanup

## üìä Health Checks

### Available Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Basic health check
- `GET /ping` - Simple ping endpoint
- `GET /cors-test` - CORS configuration test

### Expected Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Byte Club API is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-22T05:41:22.647Z",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **MongoDB Connection**: Ensure MONGO_URI is correct and accessible
2. **CORS Errors**: Check allowed origins in production
3. **JWT Issues**: Verify JWT_SECRET is set and consistent
4. **Port Conflicts**: Ensure PORT is available and not in use

### Logs
- All requests are logged with timestamps
- Error logs include stack traces
- Database operations are logged
- Authentication attempts are tracked

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor database performance
- Check error logs
- Update dependencies regularly
- Backup database regularly

### Scaling Considerations
- MongoDB Atlas handles scaling automatically
- Consider load balancing for multiple instances
- Monitor memory usage and connection pools

## üìù Notes

- The backend is fully production-ready
- All TypeScript errors have been resolved
- CORS is properly configured for production
- Database migrations are working correctly
- Security measures are in place
- Performance optimizations are applied

The application is ready for deployment to production environments like Vercel, Railway, or any Node.js hosting platform.
