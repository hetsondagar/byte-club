# 48-Hour Streak System

## Overview
The Byte Club streak system has been updated to use a 48-hour window instead of daily resets. This provides more flexibility for users while still encouraging regular activity.

## How It Works

### Backend (Already Implemented)
- **Location**: `backend/src/utils/xp.ts` - `updateStreak()` function
- **Logic**: 
  - If user hasn't solved anything for more than 48 hours, streak resets to 1
  - If user solves something within 48 hours, streak increments
  - Streak is updated every time a user successfully completes a challenge

### Frontend (Updated)
- **Location**: `frontend/src/lib/streak.ts`
- **Key Functions**:
  - `updateStreakOnActivity()`: Updates streak and returns `streakBroken` flag
  - `checkStreakStatus()`: Checks if streak should be broken without updating
  - `loadUserStreak()`: Loads current streak state from localStorage

### Notifications
- **Location**: `frontend/src/hooks/useStreakNotifications.tsx`
- **Behavior**:
  - Checks streak status when app loads
  - Shows warning notification if streak is broken
  - Checks periodically (every hour) for streak breaks
  - Shows immediate notification when streak breaks during activity

## Key Changes Made

1. **Frontend Streak Logic**: Updated from daily-based to 48-hour based
2. **Notification System**: Added global streak break notifications
3. **Quest Integration**: Updated quest completion to show streak break notifications
4. **Time Tracking**: Added `lastActiveTime` field for precise 48-hour tracking

## Testing

Run the test function in browser console:
```javascript
testStreakLogic()
```

This will test:
- First activity (streak = 1)
- Activity within 48 hours (streak increments)
- Activity after 48+ hours (streak resets, shows notification)
- Status checking without updates

## User Experience

- Users get a 48-hour grace period instead of daily resets
- Clear notifications when streaks are broken
- Immediate feedback when solving challenges after a break
- Encourages regular but flexible participation

## Database Schema

The backend already supports this with:
- `currentStreak`: Current streak count
- `lastChallengeDate`: Timestamp of last challenge completion
- Automatic streak calculation based on 48-hour window
