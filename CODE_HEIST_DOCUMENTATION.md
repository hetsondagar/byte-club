## üìã Game Rules

### Card Types

| Card Name | Type | Effect |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **Firewall** | Defense | Blocks one attack until next turn |
| **Debugger** | Recon | Peek at one player's hand or discard pile |
| **Botnet** | Attack | Compare hands with another player; lower loses a life |
| **VPN Cloak** | Defense | Avoid being targeted for one turn |
| **System Override** | Swap | Swap your hand with another player's hand |
| **Encryption Key** | Mandatory | Must be held if holding System Override or Botnet |
| **Master Algorithm** | Ultimate | If discarded or eliminated while holding, you lose immediately |
| **Exploit Script** | Attack | Force a player to discard a card of their choice |

### Game Flow

1. **Setup**: 3-6 players, each starts with 1 card and 1-2 lives
2. **Turn Structure**:
   - Draw 1 card from deck
   - Play 1 card and resolve its effect
   - End turn (passes to next player)
3. **Win Condition**: Last player standing wins!

### Special Rules

- Maximum 2 cards in hand at once
- Encryption Key required to play System Override or Botnet
- When deck is empty, shuffle discard pile
- Losing Master Algorithm = instant elimination
